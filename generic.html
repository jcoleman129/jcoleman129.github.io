									<h3 class="major">My Family Background</h3>
									<p> TLDR: I'm a California native, born as the middle child of a Christian family of 7 kids + 2 parents. I was born in SoCal, but I've grown up in the Bay Area since age 5. I went to high school in Fremont & Fairfield, college in Fairfield & San Jose. I've worked all over the Bay Area in various roles & industries, working now as a Customer Success Manager at a Silicon Valley startup. I come from a multi-cultural, multi-generational military family, but my siblings and I are the first generation that has not enlisted in military service. It really wasn't until high school that I slowly started to realize & appreciate the rich diversity of my family's Asian-American history.</p>

									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic10.jpg" alt="" /></span>My Dad's side of the family has a legacy of military involvement. My Grandpa was a Scotch-Irish, US Army man that fought in both World War II and the Vietnam War. While he was stationed in Kyoto, Japan during World War II, he met the love of his life, my Japanese Grandma. They got married and had 3 of their 5 kids (my Dad being among those 3) in Japan before moving back to the States in the mid 1960s. My Dad grew up and went to high school here in the States, met my Mom after high school and joined the Air Force as an aircraft mechanic. Thanks to the testimony of my Mom, my Dad encountered Christ before they got married. During his time of military service, the Lord used a series of events to call him to ministry. Thus, he left the military and by faith went to study at Bible College with a wife and 2 kids - my older brother and me.</p>

									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic12.jpg" alt="" /></span>The story of my Mom's side of the family begins in the Philippine Islands. My Lola Lily was born right around the time when the Japanese invaded the Philippines during World War II. She experienced first-hand the horror of the Japanese invasion. She moved to the States in the 1950s to start a new life for her future family, working in agriculture on a family farm. My mom was her first of 4 children born here in the States. My Lola wanted my Mom and her siblings to grow up as "Americans", so my Mom never really learned Tagalog or had much exposure to the Filipino culture. My Mom also went to high school here in the States, met my Dad shortly after high school, and she met Christ in the 1980s at a small Bible Study. After marrying my Dad, she also served in the Air Force Reserves before becoming a full-time mother.</p>

									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>Given the Japanese heritage on my Dad's side and a Filipino influence on my Mom's side, you can only imagine the culture clash inherent with the history of these two different cultures coming together as a family through my parents' marriage. However, I honestly believe that because my parents knew Christ, their love for Him and for each other saw past their two, very different family backgrounds. Together, they determine that the Christian legacy in the Coleman family would start with them. And I can't help but thank God for His grace in allowing my parents to carry on their Christian heritage to the next generation, to me and my siblings.
